This HW is a SOIC-16 ZIF-socket programming board for the
EFM8BB1. It is really simple: it has a socket for the USB
debugger, the ZIF socket, and an LED and speaker to indicate
that the board was programmed correctly. The layout is
deliberately single-sided through-hole to ease construction.

This project is part of the
*[Desert Lizard](http:/github.com/DesertLizard)* project, an
open-hardware open-source beginner e-jewelry and
construction tutorial project!
